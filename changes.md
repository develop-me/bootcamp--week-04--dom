## Done

- Use .forEach() instead of for loop for DocumentFragment examples
- Use .prepend(), .append(), .before(), and .after()
- .offsetWidth() and .offsetHeight() - includes borders, padding, etc.

- event.path - for checking things about parent items
- Remove event.type notes - not all that useful
- Talk about removeEventListener() in advanced events
- window is global scope in browsers
- Delegation working with new elements
- Talk about shims - maybe use for prepend/append/etc
