# The DOM: Creating Elements

---

## Exercises

Create a new `.js` file for each exercise. You may want to put each exercise in a new directory.

**Compare your result with the demo**.

### 01

Using `rhubarb.html`. With JavaScript, add 100 paragraphs to the `<main>` that all say "Rhubarb".

### 02

Using the `colours.html` file. With JavaScript, add a list of all the different colours used by the `<div>`s.

e.g. When it's done:

```html
<h2>The boxes are:</h2>
<ul id="colours">
    <li>aliceblue</li>
    <li>antiquewhite</li>
    ...
    <li>yellowgreen</li>
</ul>
```

## Tricksy

### 03

Using `alphabet.html`. With JavaScript, create a `<ul>` that contains an `<li>` for each letter of the alphabet.

**Hint**: every character on the keyboard has a "Character Code" associated with it: e.g. "A" is 65. We can use `String.fromCharCode(65)` to get back the letter "A".

### 04

Using `phobias.html`. With JavaScript, take the following array of strings and list it alphabetically using a list of lists, where each top level list represents a new first letter (see the example below).

```javascript
let strings = [
    "katastichophobia",
    "rhabdophobia",
    "eisoptrophobia",
    "papaphobia",
    "hypegiaphobia",
    "odontophobia",
    "ergophobia",
    "pteronophobia",
    "taphephobia",
    "apiphobia",
];
```

### 05

Using `grid.html`. With JavaScript, create a 64×64 grid of `<span>` elements, each one 10px square. The top left corner should have background `rgb(0,0,127)` and the bottom right should have background `rgb(255,255,127)`. The `r` value should go up by 4 with each column and the `g` value should go up by 4 with each row. The `b` value should be fixed at `127`.

## Über-Tricksy

### 06

Using `canvas.html`. Try and recreate the colour grid above, but [using `<canvas>`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/CanvasRenderingContext2D), only make the grid 256×256 and go up in value by 1 instead of 4.
